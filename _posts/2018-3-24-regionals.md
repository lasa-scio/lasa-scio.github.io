Congrats to the regionals teams! We had a great tournament this past weekend in Katy, TX – our A team placed 1st, and our B team placed 3rd (barely missing 2nd!) out of 20 competing teams. This means we qualify for the state tournament, and will be moving on to compete at Texas A&M in College Station on April 20 and 21!
